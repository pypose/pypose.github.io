          PyTorch Enterprise Support Program is a participatory program that enables service providers to develop and offer tailored enterprise-grade support to their customers.
            This program was created in direct response to feedback from PyTorch enterprise users who are deploying models in production at scale for mission-critical applications.

            Microsoft is one of the founding members and also the inaugural participant of the program. Microsoft offers PyTorch Enterprise on Azure as a part of Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msservices/premier-support">Premier</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msservices/unified-support-solutions?activetab=pivot1:primaryr4">Unified</a> Support.
            The PyTorch Enterprise support service includes long-term support to selected versions of PyTorch for up to 2 years, prioritized troubleshooting, and the latest integration with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/">Azure Machine Learning</a> and other PyTorch add-ons including ONNX Runtime for faster inference.

        <h2>OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
        <p>
          All hotfixes done by Participants for their enterprise customers will be tested and fed back to the PyTorch long-term support (LTS) and other branches regularly. As a PyTorch user, you can use the LTS release branches of PyTorch. Program Participants will prioritize and answer pull requests of customers subscribed to their support services.
          Any other PRs are reviewed the same as how they are handled for PyTorch. Development of PyTorch, including LTS branches and releases as a foundation for the PyTorch Enterprise Support Program, will continue to be in the open and open source.
